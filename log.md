### Day 22: February 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did some polish up reading the golang book.

**Thoughts:** I think the golang book is the best place to learn go as a start

### Day 21: February 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working with controllers, models to create the API routes for the go CRUD app. Quite hectic but with help of GORP the ORM part was a bit sorted.

**Thoughts:** doing the database connection almost had me after I forgot my localhost pass. Man. Never had a long, fruitless de-bugging session. Ended up guessing.

### Day 20: February 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started on intermediate GoLang. I want to create a simple CRUD app and dive into the strings of Go programming. Later on I would like to expose endpoints for my project and hook in that React baby!

**Thoughts:** installation of Revel was a bitch. Seriously. I spent over an hour trying to figure out why it's recreating deleted folders till I just restarted my PC and BOOM!

**Link to work:** Not today :wink:

### Day 19: February 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went through some React JS Conf. 2016 videos. Some cool stuff going on in the React and React-Native scene.

**Thoughts:** I was glad that many front-end developers are embracing React and the mobile developers are embracing React Natives.

**Link to work:** Not today :wink:

### Day 18: February 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Progressive Web Apps.

**Thoughts:** The Google guide is fine. Still working on it and understanding the edges so hopefully end of this weekend I will have enough to do something on my own.

**Link to work:** Not today :wink:

### Day 17: February 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I dived right into Progressive Web Apps.

**Thoughts:** There is a plethora of stuff on getting started on PWAs. I decided to use Google's guide and I'm almost done.

**Link to work:** Not today :wink:

### Day 16: February 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Github pages. I deployed my past react projects to Github pages.

**Thoughts:** I have run into a problem making the default url be a react app.

### Day 15: February 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I worked on custom analytics for a site.

**Thoughts:** Investigate more on Cassandra DB

**Link to work:** Not today :wink:

### Day 14: January 31sh, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished up the ReactJs weather app

**Thoughts:** I need another project to finesse what I have learnt

### Day 13: January 30th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I worked on a google chrome extension. This extension just allows you to use GTmetrix to check the site speed of whatever site you happened to be browsing, just by clicking a button.

**Thoughts:** I was womdering how google chrome extensions work and was suprised that it's actually simple to come up with one. I hope I will create more extensions soon.

### Day 12: January 27th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked with InfluxDB and Grafana. I came up with more precise queries for Grafana visualization. Then I explored some other options for data sources for Grafana and since I have a MySQL db with lots of data that was the next option.

**Thoughts:** Grafana currently does not have an official MySQL plugin. Bummer. So one kind human [Sraos](https://github.com/sraoss/grafana-sqldb-datasource) made one for us. And guess what? It's working. Not for me cos I had serious issues trying to set up my own clone of Grafana so that I could use the MySQL plugin with ease. So I guess when I fix that ~~or Grafana merge this PR~~ then I will be able to connect to my DB. Well. Waiting to accomplish that tomorrow cos I'm out.

**Link to work:** InfluxDB and Grafana will come later ;)

### Day 11: January 26th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked with InfluxDB and Grafana. I made some test entries into InfluxDB and then plotted them on Grafana by creating some queries. I also worked on Moonie web where I created some DB logic.

**Thoughts:** Using InfluxDB APIs to send data to the data store was a bit hectic. I had intended to use a front-end client but it seemed to give me a lot of blockers esp. using AJAX. So I opted for back-end python client and it works well. As for Grafana, coming up with the correct query has never been that difficult.

**Link to work:** [Moonie](https://github.com/musale/moonie/commits/master) , InfluxDB and Grafana will come later ;)

### Day 10: January 25th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked with InfluxDB and Grafana. InfluxDB is a time series DB while Grafana is a visualization tool which I will be using for time series data. I also fixed some bug in my weather app and added new routes to the detail page where I will display some more info.

**Thoughts:** Configuring InfluxDB was a bit hectic for me. I should write my people out there a little blog or something. Especially those who use ```Vagrant```. Generally, a good experience. I can't wait to start visualizing data.

### Day 9: January 24th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I created a twitter bot that will be tweeting the commits I make to this repo.

**Thoughts:** Creating the bot code was a bit easy using python, github and twitter APIs. A little problem I faced was making it into a cron job in one of my servers. In my local machine the cron worked perfect, in my server, I had a little bit of a problem getting it to work.

### Day 8: January 23rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 on react JS weather app.

**Thoughts:** I went through step 2 to step 8. using components and containers abstractions was quite hectic but I pulled through. Last commit had a bug. I will fix tomorrow.

### Day 7: January 20th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the react JS tutorial.

### Day 6: January 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Day 3 on react JS tutorial.

**Thoughts:** we went through ```stateless functional components```, ```proptypes``` which help in de-bugging and documentation and we also did separating componente i.e. ```container components``` from ```presentational components```. I think following a 'programming structure' where by you abstract your program's functionality like this would be a great way to come up with clean, refactored and easy to maintain code.

### Day 5: January 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 on react JS tutorial.

**Thoughts:** I learnt about react routes and child props. Routes are a bit tricky to grasp but with time I want to be very good at them

### Day 4: January 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started on a react js tutorial.

**Thoughts:** I see this approach better as I can be able to have a follow through. I also like video tutorial and [this] (https://online.reacttraining.com) react tutorial is so far so good. I hope to finish it by end of next week so whoop! whoop!

### Day 3: January 11th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up a new website I am working on. It is an e-commerce site.
